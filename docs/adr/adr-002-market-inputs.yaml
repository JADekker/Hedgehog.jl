title: "Market Inputs Structure"
status: Accepted
date: 2025-03-11
context: |
  Market data, such as volatility surfaces and discount curves, must be structured separately from pricing methods.
  `marketInputs` should represent external market conditions relevant for pricing.

decision: |
  - Define a `marketInputs` type that subtypes `AbstractMarketInputs`.
  - This struct should contain market parameters (e.g., spot price, volatility, interest rate) but not pricing logic.
  - Market inputs should be designed for easy extension to support additional factors.

consequences:
  positive:
    - "Keeps market data independent of pricing models, allowing flexible combinations."
    - "New market models can be added without modifying existing pricing methods."
  negative:
    - "Requires explicitly defining each market input struct."

alternatives:
  - name: "Pass market data as separate function arguments"
    pros: "Avoids struct overhead and keeps the API simple."
    cons: "Less structured and harder to extend for new market conditions."
