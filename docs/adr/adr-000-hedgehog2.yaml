status: Accepted
date: 2025-03-11
context: |
  Hedgehog2.jl is a derivatives pricing library designed for modularity and extensibility.
  It provides flexible pricing methods, market inputs, and payoff structures.
  
  Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are used to document key design choices. Each ADR answers a specific design question.

decision: |
  - The ADR system ensures all features follow existing design choices.
  - The library follows a structured approach using `Pricer{A, B, C}` for pricing and `GreekCalculator{G, A, B, C}` for sensitivities.
  - ADR retrieval must be prioritized when implementing new features.

consequences:
  positive:
    - "Ensures consistency in design decisions across all features."
    - "Provides a structured way to track and evolve architecture."
  negative:
    - "Developers must check ADRs before implementing new features."
