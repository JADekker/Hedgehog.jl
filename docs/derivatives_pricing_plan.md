| **20** | **API Consistency** | Ensure clean interfaces for `Pricer`, `MarketData`, and `MonteCarlo` components |
| **21** | **Modularization** | Refactor pricing models, calibration routines, and market data |
| **22** | **Unit Tests** | Cover Monte Carlo, PDE, Fourier, and rate models |
| **23** | **Example Scripts** | Provide standalone scripts for different models |

---

## 3️⃣ Finalization Phase
**Goal:** Make the library production-ready with documentation and optimizations.

| Step  | Focus Area | Details |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **24** | **Documentation** | Write structured guides and tutorials (Jupyter notebooks, standalone docs) |
| **25** | **Performance Optimization** | Improve numerical stability, parallelization, and computation speed |
| **26** | **Benchmarking & Validation** | Compare different pricing methods for speed and accuracy |
