# Hedgehog

**Hedgehog** is a modular, SciML-inspired derivatives pricing library in Julia.

## üìê Design Overview

All pricing and calibration workflows follow a SciML-inspired `solve(problem, method)` interface.

To compute a price, you define a `PricingProblem` using:

- A **payoff** (e.g. European call, American put)
- A set of **market inputs** (e.g. Black-Scholes inputs, Heston inputs)
- Then solve it with a **pricing method** (e.g. Monte Carlo, analytical formula, Fourier inversion)

```julia
payoff = VanillaOption(...)
market = BlackScholesInputs(...)
problem = PricingProblem(payoff, market)

sol = solve(problem, BlackScholesAnalytic())
price = sol.price
```

## ‚úÖ Supported Payoffs

- European Call / Put
- American Call / Put
- Planned: Digital and Barrier, Asian

## üß† Supported Models (Price Dynamics)

- Black-Scholes (`LognormalDynamics`)
- Heston (`HestonDynamics`)
- Planned: Hull-White (short-rate), Variance Gamma, Rough Bergomi

## ‚öôÔ∏è Pricing Methods

- Analytical formulas (Black-Scholes)
- Binomial Trees (Cox‚ÄìRoss‚ÄìRubinstein)
- Monte Carlo:
  - Euler‚ÄìMaruyama
  - Exact simulation (Black-Scholes, Broadie‚ÄìKaya for Heston)
- Fourier methods (Carr‚ÄìMadan; COS coming soon)
- PDE methods (Crank‚ÄìNicolson, in progress)

## üìä Calibration

Hedgehog supports calibration via a unified interface:

- Solve for implied volatility using `CalibrationProblem`
- Invert volatility surfaces
- Build fully calibrated `RectVolSurface` objects from price matrices

## üßÆ Sensitivities

- Greeks supported via a `GreekProblem` interface:
  - Finite differences
  - Automatic differentiation
  - `BatchGreekProblem` to compute a full gradient of sensitivities

## üöÄ Highlights

- Modular by construction: models, payoffs, and methods are swappable
- Unified `solve(problem, method)` interface across pricing and calibration
- Inspired by the SciML architecture and ecosystem
- Built on top of SciML components (StochasticDiffEq.jl, NonlinearSolve.jl, Integrals.jl)
- Open-source and focused on prototyping cutting-edge methods
