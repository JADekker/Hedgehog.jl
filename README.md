# Hedgehog2

[![Build Status](https://github.com/aleCombi/Hedgehog2.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/aleCombi/Hedgehog2.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)


# Roadmap

- price calls with blackscholes, binomial tree, montecarlo.
- greeks with AD, finite differences, analytical
- define a generic workflow for derivatives pricing
- define all the necessary abstract types to be ultra-generic
- setup testing

# Ideas
- keep it generic, abstract, functional
- develop horizontally, not vertically
- think of a MVP state to set a concrete goal
- keep the project well structured: keep an ADR, github project, msft todo, something similar (not too hard to commit to)
- focus on innovation points to differentiate
- thorough documentation from the start (start from structure)
