We have a modular derivatives pricing framework in Julia, organized as follows:

1. An `AbstractPayoff` type with concrete payoffs like `VanillaEuropeanCall`, which is callable on a spot price.

2. `AbstractMarketInputs` to represent market data. We have a `BlackScholesInputs` concrete type storing rate, spot, and sigma. We can extend with more complex market inputs, e.g., local volatility parameters, yield curves, or multiple underlying assets.

3. An `AbstractPricingStrategy` type for the pricing model. We currently have a `BlackScholesStrategy` with an analytical formula for vanilla European options. We can add Monte Carlo or PDE-based methods by subtyping `AbstractPricingStrategy`.

4. A `Pricer` struct that ties (payoff, market inputs, strategy) together into a callable. It uses the logic within its `pricingStrategy` to return a price.

5. A `DeltaCalculator` struct that references a `Pricer` and a `deltaMethod` (subtype of `AbstractDeltaMethod`). We have two methods: 
   - `BlackScholesAnalyticalDelta` for the closed-form expression.
   - `ADDelta` using automatic differentiation via ForwardDiff.

Goal: I'd like to extend this framework in several ways:
- Support new payoffs, e.g., put options, digital options, barrier options.
- Support new pricing methods, e.g., a Monte Carlo approach or a PDE approach for the same payoffs.
- Handle path-dependent payoffs (Asian or lookback) with the relevant pricing strategy or a more general simulation approach.
- Provide additional Greeks (Gamma, Theta, Vega) with both analytical formulas and AD-based approaches.
- Explore how to handle multi-asset payoffs and correlations.

Please give me example code and an explanation of how to integrate these new features into the existing framework while respecting the modular design. Focus on how we can systematically add them without breaking existing functionality or code. Also, explain potential performance considerations, best practices for code organization, and how to test each new extension.
